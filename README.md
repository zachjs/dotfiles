# dotfiles

Author: Zachary Snow (zach@zachjs.com)

This repository a work in progress. The goal is to have a unified repository for
all of my important dotfiles which is shared across all hosts I use. Ideally,
getting everything set up will take a single step.

## Specifics
- whitelist of available dotfiles
- does not overwrite existing dotfiles
- plugins are tracked using submodules

## To-Dos
- more robust setup script
- automatically run PlugInstall
- address TODOs in zshrc
- bring in more dotfiles
- may be worth tracking vim-plug plugins using submodules
