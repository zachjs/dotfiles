# dotfiles

Author: Zachary Snow (zach@zachjs.com)

This repository is very much a work in progress. The goal is to have a unified
reposity for all of my important dotfiles which is shared across all hosts I
use.

## Outstanding tasks
- more robust setup script
- automatic setup of Oh My Zsh (submodules?)
- track my custom Oh My Zsh theme
- automatically run PlugInstall
- address TODOs in zshrc
- bring in more dotfiles
